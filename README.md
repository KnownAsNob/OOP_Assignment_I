Assignment repository for C16391553 OOP Assignment I

My project for OOP Assignment I is a futuristic photon type reactor that can generate huge amounts of power while requiring relatively little space.
This make it a very suitable installation for a space craft! Power on the reactor by using the UP key. This will cause the inhibition lazers to fire,
creating the energy core. Be careful of the temperature! Energy cores such as this one tend to become unstable when reaching high temperatures (50 degrees
celcius, for this demonstration!) so make sure to keep the coolant flowing to avoid catastrophie. If the core reaches critical temperatures, it will begin
to emit deadley, unpredictable leakage in the form of small photons.
